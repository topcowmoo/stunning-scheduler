# Stunning Scheduler

Welcome to my Stunning Scheduler repo. I was tasked with creating a calendar app that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical work day by modifying and enhancing the starter code. It features HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is run in the browser. It also features the use of the following third[-party API's - Bootstrap, Day.js and jQuery. As was the case in my previous challenge repo (https://topcowmoo.github.io/deep-machine/) I used pseudocode to help with the JavaScript logic. It was fun learning about third-party API's especially Bootstrap. Thanks for stopping by.

Here's a screenshot of a partially filled in scheduler:
